As a .NET developer, I designed and implemented the Watch Store project using the latest technologies and following the microservices architecture pattern. The project consists of several independent microservices that communicate with each other using RESTful APIs and asynchronous messaging through RabbitMQ. The project uses ASP.NET CORE API for building RESTful APIs, MSSQL, MangoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis for data storage and retrieval, and API Gateway (Ocelot Library) for routing requests to the appropriate microservices. Docker and Docker Compose are used for containerization and deployment of the microservices. Secure access to the APIs is implemented using AccessToken/RefreshToken and IdentityServer4. The project also uses the CQRS pattern for separating the write and read sides of the application, enabling scalability and performance optimizations. Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles are followed throughout the project, ensuring that each microservice has a clear and well-defined purpose and domain. Asynchronous and synchronous communication between the microservices is used to improve performance and enable scaling. Redis is used as a high-performance, in-memory data store for caching frequently accessed data and reducing the load on the database servers. Overall, the Sport Store project demonstrates my expertise in .NET development, microservices architecture, containerization, asynchronous messaging, security, and DDD principles. I am proud to have designed and implemented a complex project that leverages cutting-edge technologies and best practices.
